CabPal
=======

Fast Cab Battle Hack app

=======

An app which allows anyone to book a cab anytime and anywhere.

We are using Twilio API to make the voice call to the taxi company for you,
and get the confirmation back to you, so you can easily pay by PayPal.

=======

This app can be use by:
- disabled people such as deaf and mute,
- it's a perfect after-party app, when taxi company can't understand your mumbling,
- in the situation when you've a very bad reception (like in the train), then book a cab only by one press of button,
and many more.

Next release would include:
- ordering different type of taxis on different times,
- voice recognition provided by Twilio API, to check the exact time of arrival,
- etc.
