Fast Cab Battle Hack app

=======

Hello, we are creating an app to allow anyone to book a cab.

We will using twilio api to make the voice call to the taxi company for you,
and get the confirmation back to you.

While you wait you can either pay in advance or after the journey using paypal.

=======

This app can be use by:
- disabled people such as deaf and mute,
- it's a perfect after-party app, when taxi company can't understand your mumbling,
- in the situation when you've a very bad reception (like in the train), then book a cab only by one press of button,
and many more.

Next release would include:
- ordering different type of taxis on different times,
- voice recognition provided by Twilio API, to check the exact time of arrival,
- etc.
